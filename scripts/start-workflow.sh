Implement only the work described in this branch workspace.
Start with Lite Read and escalate only when risk signals require more context.
Use TDD when the branch changes core logic, regression risk, integration contracts, or bug fixes.
Use Decision Option Briefs for high-impact choices before implementation.
Do not expand scope without updating this plan.

# ${title} Human Confirmation Gates

Use this file to record when AI should stop and ask for human confirmation.

## Scope Confirm

- Status: pending
- Ask human to confirm:
  - branch/workspace
  - included scope
  - excluded scope
  - impacted Source of Truth docs
- Human response:

## Contract Confirm

- Status: pending
- Ask human to confirm:
  - data model changes
  - interface/API/CLI/UI contract changes
  - external dependencies
  - shared Source of Truth changes
- Human response:

## Scope Change Confirm

- Status: not needed
- Ask human when:
  - work expands beyond \`plan.md\`
  - a feature should move to another branch
  - implementation reveals a new product decision
- Human response:

## Verification Confirm

- Status: pending
- Ask human to confirm:
  - test/build/smoke commands
  - TDD evidence or skip reason
  - CI/check commands
  - manual verification path
  - completion criteria
- Human response:

## Quality Gate Confirm

- Status: pending
- Ask human to confirm:
  - TDD applies or is intentionally skipped
  - required branch checks and CI gates
  - skipped checks and reasons
  - deploy/publish gate if relevant
- Human response:

## Git Sync Confirm

- Status: pending
- Ask human to confirm:
  - start sync command/result before implementation
  - mid-phase upstream change action
  - pre-merge sync command/result before completion
- Human response:

## Sync Conflict Confirm

- Status: not needed
- Ask human when:
  - main changed during the Phase
  - shared Source of Truth docs conflict with this branch
  - merge/rebase/pull/push/PR action is needed
- Human response:

## Completion Confirm

- Status: pending
- Ask human to confirm:
  - changed summary
  - verification result
  - remaining risk
  - next task context
- Human response:

## Integration Conflict Confirm

- Status: not needed
- Ask human when:
  - this branch integrates multiple source branches
  - shared data model or interface conflicts exist
  - acceptance/regression/manual verification paths conflict
- Human response:

# ${title} Next Action Menu

Use this file to guide the human through the next collaboration choice.

## Current State

- State: workspace created
- Summary: branch workspace exists, but scope still needs human confirmation.

## Recommended Next Action

- Ask for Scope Confirm.
- Reason: implementation should not start until branch/workspace, included scope, excluded scope, and impacted docs are clear.

## Options

1. Confirm scope and continue to Contract Confirm.
2. Revise scope before implementation.
3. Split part of the work into another branch.
4. Pause this workspace.

## Waiting On Human

- Please choose one option or give a natural language instruction.

## Last User Choice

- 

## Next AI Action

- If option 1 is chosen, update \`confirmations.md\`, then draft or confirm shared contracts.
- If option 2 is chosen, update \`plan.md\` and \`shared-docs.md\`.
- If option 3 is chosen, create another workspace with \`scripts/start-workflow.sh\`.
- If option 4 is chosen, record the pause reason in \`notes.md\`.
