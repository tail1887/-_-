# 13. Human Command Flow

This document shows how a human can drive the harness with short commands while AI handles workspace updates, validation, and confirmation gates.

## 1) Start A New Feature

Human says:

```text
feature/task-crud workspace 만들어서 범위 초안 잡아줘
```

AI does:

- Runs `scripts/start-workflow.sh feature task-crud "Task CRUD"` or asks before checkout if Git state is risky.
- Drafts `plan.md`, `sync.md`, and `quality.md`.
- Presents the Workspace Created or Start Sync Required next-action menu.
- Asks for Scope Confirm and, when needed, Git Sync Confirm.

## 2) Confirm Before Implementation

Human says:

```text
1번으로 진행, TDD 적용해
```

AI does:

- Updates `confirmations.md`.
- Updates `quality.md` with TDD plan and first failing test target.
- Updates `next-actions.md`.
- Proceeds only inside accepted scope.
- Asks for Quality Gate Confirm if TDD or check requirements are unclear.

Human says:

```text
선택 후보를 영향까지 비교해서 보여줘
```

AI does:

- Classifies the decision type using `docs/14-decision-option-brief.md`.
- Presents 1-3 filtered candidates.
- Lists excluded options and exclusion reasons.
- Recommends one option while leaving final choice to the human.

## 3) Handle Main Changes During Work

AI says:

```text
진행 중 main 변경이 감지됐습니다. 지금 반영할까요, 위험을 기록하고 계속할까요?
```

Human says:

```text
main 반영하고 계속
```

AI does:

- Stops implementation.
- Reports dirty-worktree and impacted Source of Truth docs.
- Asks for Git Sync Confirm or Sync Conflict Confirm before pull, merge, or rebase.
- Records the result in `sync.md` and `notes.md`.

Human says:

```text
A안으로 가고 제외한 선택지는 다음 분기로 남겨
```

AI does:

- Records the accepted option in `decisions.md`.
- Records excluded/deferred options and revisit triggers.
- Updates the relevant confirmation gate.

## 4) Verify Work

Human says:

```text
검증 돌려
```

AI does:

- Runs agreed tests/checks only.
- Records TDD, CI/check, skipped-check, and manual verification evidence in `quality.md`.
- Updates `report.md`.
- If checks fail, presents Verification Failed next-action menu.
- If checks pass, asks for Pre-Merge Sync Required or Completion Confirm.

## 5) Integrate Feature Branches

Human says:

```text
task-crud랑 blocker-view 통합 브랜치 만들어서 합칠 항목 점검해
```

AI does:

- Creates or opens an integration workspace.
- Reads source branch `plan.md`, `shared-docs.md`, `report.md`, `quality.md`, `decisions.md`, `confirmations.md`, and `sync.md`.
- Records source branch/base commit information in `sources.md`.
- Reconciles shared Source of Truth proposals in `shared-docs.md`.
- Runs `scripts/validate-harness.sh --integration`.
- Asks for Integration Conflict Confirm when shared contracts disagree.

## 6) Prepare PR

Human says:

```text
PR 준비 상태 확인해
```

AI does:

- Runs `scripts/status-workflow.sh <workspace>`.
- Checks `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- Reports missing `sync.md`, `quality.md`, confirmation, or validation items.
- Runs validation only when approved or already within the agreed verification scope.
- Does not create, push, or merge PRs without human confirmation.

## 7) Recompare A Decision

Human says:

```text
이 결정은 UI/UX 기준으로 다시 비교해줘
```

AI does:

- Reclassifies the decision as UI/UX.
- Rebuilds the Decision Option Brief with UI/UX impact fields and comparison criteria.
- Leaves the prior decision as superseded or deferred in `decisions.md` if already recorded.

Human says:

```text
추천안으로 진행하되 롤백 조건을 notes에 남겨
```

AI does:

- Records the accepted decision in `decisions.md`.
- Adds rollback/revisit conditions to `notes.md`.
- Proceeds through the relevant confirmation gate.

## 8) Ask For Current Status

Human says:

```text
지금 상태 설명해줘
```

Or:

```text
남은 위험 알려줘
다음 작업자 context만 요약해줘
완료된 거야?
```

AI does:

- Reads the Latest Report Index in `docs/reports/README.md`.
- Reads only the latest report and the most relevant related report needed for the answer.
- Treats reports as evidence for summarizing status, not as Source of Truth.
- Uses Source of Truth documents when a report conflicts with current requirements, workflow, or contract docs.
- States whether validation is `Complete`, `Pending`, `Blocked`, or `Unknown`; if a report is pending, AI does not call the work complete.
- Summarizes the latest Phase/Area, completed work, remaining work, remaining risk, next worker context, and recommended next action.
- Explains the report evidence directly instead of telling the human to open and read the report.
- Presents the Report-Based Status Requested next-action menu when a follow-up choice is needed.

## 9) Ask For CI Example

Human says:

```text
CI 예시 보여줘
```

AI does:

- Points to `.github/workflows/harness-validation.example.yml`.
- Explains it is an example, not an active provider-specific requirement.
- Helps adapt it to the target project's stack when requested.

## 10) Ask For Lightweight Context

Human says:

```text
필요한 문서만 읽고 시작해
```

Or:

```text
토큰 아끼되 위험하면 확장해
```

AI does:

- Selects Lite Read from `docs/15-context-budget-rule.md`.
- Reads `AGENTS.md`, `docs/00-layer-map.md`, workspace status output when available, and directly relevant Source of Truth files.
- States which Context Budget mode is being used and why.
- Escalates only if contract, data, security, sync, quality, integration, decision, or evidence conflict risk appears.
- Records Context Budget mode and primary/escalated context in the report.

## 11) Ask For Full Audit

Human says:

```text
전체 구조 감사해
```

Or:

```text
하네스 리스크 전체를 분석해줘
```

AI does:

- Selects Audit Read from `docs/15-context-budget-rule.md`.
- Reads Layer Map, relevant Source of Truth layers, Latest Report Index, selected reports, scripts, and tests.
- Still avoids reading every historical report or archived workspace unless the audit target requires it.
- Summarizes what was read, what was intentionally omitted, and where risk required deeper reading.

## 12) Adopt An Existing Codebase

Human says:

```text
이 기존 코드베이스에 하네스를 붙여줘
```

Or:

```text
baseline + next-change 방식으로 적용해줘
```

Or:

```text
이미 있는 기능 workspace는 만들지 마
```

AI does:

- Uses `docs/16-existing-codebase-adoption.md`.
- Selects Bounded Audit Read from `docs/15-context-budget-rule.md`.
- Scans repo structure, README/docs, package/build/test config, CI files, branch/PR policy files, and key source directories by summary first.
- Records current behavior as baseline evidence, not as guaranteed desired behavior.
- Creates a baseline report.
- Stops before overwriting existing docs, changing CI/PR/branch policy, declaring Source of Truth complete, or creating retroactive workspaces.
- Guides future changes back to normal Phase Workflow.

## 13) Assess Infrastructure Gaps

Human says:

```text
하네스 적용 전에 없는 인프라 gap부터 뽑아줘
```

Or:

```text
CI 없으면 다음 Phase 후보로 올려줘
```

Or:

```text
첫 기능 전에 막는 P0만 골라줘
```

Or:

```text
자동 테스트 없으면 수동 smoke로 임시 검증 경로 잡아줘
```

AI does:

- Uses `docs/16-existing-codebase-adoption.md` Infrastructure / Operations Gap Assessment.
- Classifies gaps as P0, P1, P2, or deferred.
- Limits P0 blocking to the first risky implementation feature, not baseline/documentation/diagnostic work.
- Allows a documented manual smoke path as a temporary verification path when automated tests do not exist.
- Proposes next Phase candidates.
- Asks the human which Phase to run first.
