# 09. Collaboration Agreement

This document records shared collaboration agreements that should not change per branch.

## 1) Shared Model

- `docs/08-development-workflow.md` defines the common workflow protocol.
- `docs/workflows/` stores branch-specific plans, notes, and reports.
- `docs/reports/` stores durable evidence after Phase or Hotfix completion.
- `docs/11-git-sync-policy.md` defines main freshness, PR, and Git safety rules.
- `docs/12-quality-gates.md` defines TDD, branch checks, CI, and CD/deploy gates.
- `docs/15-context-budget-rule.md` defines Lite/Escalate/Audit context loading.
- Source of Truth docs win over reports when they conflict.

## 2) Branch And Workspace Agreement

- Every implementation branch has a matching workspace folder.
- Branch names use `<type>/<short-kebab-name>`.
- Workspace paths use `docs/workflows/<type>/<short-kebab-name>/`.
- Use `scripts/start-workflow.sh` to create the branch and workspace together.
- Record proposed shared Source of Truth changes in `shared-docs.md`.
- Record branch freshness, base commit, upstream checks, and PR status in `sync.md`.
- Record TDD and CI/CD evidence in `quality.md`.
- Record high-impact accepted/deferred decisions in `decisions.md`.

## 3) Decision Agreement

Use this order when a decision affects implementation:

1. Identify the earliest impacted layer in `docs/00-layer-map.md`.
2. Update the Source of Truth document first.
3. Update the branch workspace plan if scope changes.
4. Record shared document patch proposals in `shared-docs.md`.
5. Implement only the agreed scope.
6. Verify and write evidence.

## 4) Human Confirmation Gates

AI should work autonomously between gates, then stop and ask the human for confirmation when a decision changes scope, contracts, verification, completion, or integration direction.

Each branch workspace records confirmation status in `confirmations.md`.

| Gate | AI asks for confirmation before | Human confirms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope Confirm | implementation starts | branch/workspace, included scope, excluded scope, impacted docs |
| Contract Confirm | shared data/interface/dependency contracts are used for implementation | data model, interface/API/CLI/UI contract, external dependency, shared Source of Truth changes |
| Scope Change Confirm | work expands beyond `plan.md` | whether to expand current branch, split another branch, or defer |
| Verification Confirm | final verification starts | test/build/smoke commands, manual verification path, completion criteria |
| Quality Gate Confirm | TDD or CI/CD expectations are unclear, skipped, or changed | failing-first evidence, branch check commands, CI requirements, skipped checks, CD/deploy gate |
| Git Sync Confirm | pull, merge, rebase, push, PR creation, or PR merge could change branch or remote state | command to run, expected branch, dirty-worktree status, base/main commit, rollback plan if relevant |
| Sync Conflict Confirm | main changed during the Phase or shared Source of Truth conflicts with the branch | whether to rebase/merge now, continue with recorded risk, split a follow-up branch, or pause |
| Completion Confirm | branch is considered done | changed summary, verification result, remaining risk, next task context |
| Integration Conflict Confirm | integration branch resolves conflicting source branch assumptions | final model/interface/acceptance/regression/manual verification direction |

If the human has already given an explicit instruction covering a gate, AI can record it in `confirmations.md` and continue.

## 5) Next Action Menu Agreement

AI should guide the human with a short next action menu after each confirmation gate, verification result, completion decision, or integration conflict.

Menus are recorded in `next-actions.md` and should include:

- current state
- recommended next action
- 2-4 options
- waiting-on-human prompt
- next AI action after selection

AI should recommend one option and explain why. The human can answer with a number or natural language.

When the human asks for status, PR readiness, or integration readiness, AI should run or reference `scripts/status-workflow.sh` and then present the closest matching menu from `docs/10-next-action-menu.md`.

## 6) Decision Option Brief Agreement

AI should use `docs/14-decision-option-brief.md` before high-impact human decisions.

Use it when:

- Scope Confirm needs a large scope choice.
- Contract Confirm needs data/API/UI contract choice.
- Quality Gate Confirm needs TDD/CI strategy choice.
- Git Sync Confirm or Sync Conflict Confirm needs merge/rebase/continue/pause choice.
- Integration Conflict Confirm needs source branch conflict resolution.
- A feature enhancement direction must be chosen.

Do not use it for small reversible choices:

- button wording
- internal variable names
- small documentation phrasing
- test names
- easy-to-revert UI placement

Decision outcomes should be recorded in `decisions.md`, and then propagated to `confirmations.md`, `notes.md`, `shared-docs.md`, `quality.md`, or `sync.md` when applicable.

## 7) Context Budget Agreement

AI should start with Lite Read unless the task is high risk or the human requested a broad review.

- Lite Read uses `AGENTS.md`, `docs/00-layer-map.md`, workspace status output when available, and directly relevant Source of Truth files.
- Escalate Read is required for contract, data, security, sync, quality, integration, decision, or Source of Truth conflict risk.
- Audit Read is allowed for whole-project structure checks, risk analysis, retrospectives, migrations, and harness evaluations.
- Token savings must not override required Source of Truth context.
- AI should record Context Budget mode and major context read in the report.

## 8) Existing Codebase Adoption Agreement

Use `docs/16-existing-codebase-adoption.md` when applying the harness to a repo that already has codebase or operational inertia.

- Record existing code, docs, CI, PR, and branch policy before changing them.
- Use baseline + next-change adoption instead of retroactive workspace generation.
- Existing code describes current behavior, not necessarily desired or correct behavior.
- Stale or unknown docs are gaps until mapped and verified.
- AI should stop before overwriting existing docs, changing CI/PR/branch policy, declaring Source of Truth complete, or creating retroactive workspaces.

## 9) Integration Agreement

Use an integration branch when combining independent feature branches.

The integration branch starts with each source branch's:

- `report.md`
- `shared-docs.md`
- `quality.md`
- `decisions.md`
- `sync.md`

It opens `plan.md`, `notes.md`, `confirmations.md`, and impacted Source of Truth files when the first pass shows ambiguity, pending gates, conflicts, stale sync, quality gaps, or contract drift.

The integration branch must record source branch/base commit information in `sources.md`.

If any source branch lacks `shared-docs.md`, `decisions.md`, `sync.md`, or source branch/base commit records, the integration branch must stop and request the missing handoff before merging.
The integration branch owns final reconciliation of:

- shared entities and data models
- interface contracts
- acceptance scenarios
- regression guards
- manual verification flows
- unresolved cross-branch questions

Before completion, integration branches should pass `scripts/validate-harness.sh --integration` or record why it was deferred.

## 10) What Needs Discussion

Discuss before implementation when a change affects:

- Product scope or user flow
- Architecture or data model
- Interface contract
- External service or deployment behavior
- Security, privacy, secrets, or permissions
- Work that crosses branch or Phase boundaries

## 11) What Does Not Need Discussion

These can usually proceed inside the current branch workspace:

- Small wording or formatting fixes
- Local refactors that do not change behavior
- Test additions that match existing behavior
- Report or note updates that do not change Source of Truth

## 12) Automation Safety Agreement

- `scripts/start-workflow.sh` must preserve existing workspace files.
- Branch checkout is refused when the worktree has uncommitted or untracked changes unless `--allow-dirty` is explicitly used.
- Use `--no-checkout` for documentation-only setup or when the current Git state should not change.
- Use `--dry-run` before creating unfamiliar branch/workspace names.
- Use `git pull --ff-only` as the default main update command only after human confirmation.
- Prefer PR-based integration over direct main push.
- Do not automate pull, merge, rebase, push, PR creation, or PR merge without a confirmation gate.
- Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` for PR handoff when the project uses PRs.
- Treat `.github/workflows/harness-validation.example.yml` as an optional CI example, not an active requirement.

## 13) Completion Agreement

A branch is complete when:

- Scope in `plan.md` is satisfied or explicitly deferred.
- `report.md` has `Workspace state: ready-for-review`, `complete`, or `integration-ready` as appropriate.
- Required human confirmation gates are recorded in `confirmations.md`.
- Current next action menu is recorded in `next-actions.md`.
- Git sync and PR status are recorded in `sync.md`.
- TDD and CI/CD quality gate status are recorded in `quality.md`.
- High-impact choices are recorded in `decisions.md`.
- Context Budget mode and primary/escalated context are recorded in `report.md` or the Phase report.
- Shared Source of Truth changes are recorded in `shared-docs.md` when applicable.
- Pre-Merge Sync result or deferral reason is recorded before PR/completion.
- Acceptance, regression, and manual verification are checked.
- `report.md` or `docs/reports/` records changed, verified, remaining, and next context.
- No secrets or unrelated changes are included.
