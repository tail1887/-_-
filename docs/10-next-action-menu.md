# 10. Next Action Menu

This document defines the conversational UI protocol for guiding the human through collaboration choices.

AI should not ask an open-ended "what next?" when the harness state can suggest useful options. Instead, AI should summarize the current state, recommend one next action, and offer 2-4 choices.

## Response Shape

## State Menus

### Decision Option Brief Required

- Current state: a high-impact human decision affects scope, contract, quality, sync, integration, or enhancement direction.
- Recommended next action: present a Decision Option Brief.
- Options:
  1. Compare candidate options with the matching decision type template.
  2. Narrow the candidates first.
  3. Defer the decision to another branch.
- Next AI action: create a brief from `docs/14-decision-option-brief.md` and wait for human choice.
- Ask: "이 결정은 영향이 커서 후보별 영향과 제외 이유까지 비교해도 될까요?"

### Decision Option Selected

- Current state: the human selected a Decision Option Brief candidate.
- Recommended next action: record the decision and continue through the relevant confirmation gate.
- Options:
  1. Record accepted decision and continue.
  2. Record accepted decision but pause implementation.
  3. Reopen comparison with different criteria.
- Next AI action: update `decisions.md`, then update `confirmations.md`, `notes.md`, `shared-docs.md`, `quality.md`, or `sync.md` as needed.
